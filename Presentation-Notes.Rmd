## Introduction

####Salt entering a lake is the main cause of density differences between the epilimnion and hyoplimnion. An increase in this difference causes a greater inhibitor of mixing. (Judd 1970).
#### When a lake fails to mix, especially a eutrophic lake,it can become redox stratified. Redox stratification can lead to persistant anoxia which can lead to a multitude of problems like production and accumulation of things like nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate. (Wyman and Kortesky 2018).
