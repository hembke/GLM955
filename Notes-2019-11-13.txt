Salt scenarios :  Make increasing salt concentration
We were able to run the model with inflow yay! 

Our scenarios:
-- Increase the amount over the year then see how much it is per day ---


1) Each each increase the salinity input by X percent
2) Make the salt concentration go exponentially over time
3) Making salt go up exponentially then decrease over time --> Remediation
4) Think about the season and when the salt goes in.

If we really have time:
Sensitivity of the inflows --> how does that change the RMSE

What we need to learn how to do:
- Export the contour plot data for temperature and salinity --> calculate the thermocline using rLakeAnalyzer

What we are wondering about
- If we don't use any inflow temp data and just inflow salt --> we will not use and note that as a caveat in the presentation
