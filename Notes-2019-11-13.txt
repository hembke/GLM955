Salt scenarios :  Make increasing salt concentration
We were able to run the model with inflow yay! 

Let's get our data in order first!
1) double check residence time against inflows (Linnea)
2) add temp data to mendota inflow (Hilary)
3)use outflow file for mendota model as input for inflow of monona (should be in lake.csv or output.nc) (TBD)
4) make sure chloride is translated to salinity (.61) in your own personal files. Our baseline values are 19.5mg/L for Mendota inflow, 12.2 mg/L for in-lake Mendota starting, 15.3 mg/L for in-lake Monona starting



Our scenarios:
-- Increase the amount over the year then see how much it is per day ---


1) Each each increase the salinity input by X percent (10, 100, 1000%)
  Increase across the board (Patricia)
  Increase linearly (Adam wrote fn)
  Increase exponentially (Adam writing fn)
      If we have time) Remediate halfway through simulation
      If we really have time)
      Sensitivity of the inflows --> how does that change the RMSE

What we need to learn how to do:
- Export the contour plot data for temperature and salinity --> calculate the thermocline using rLakeAnalyzer

What we are wondering about
- If we don't use any inflow temp data and just inflow salt --> we will not use and note that as a caveat in the presentation
